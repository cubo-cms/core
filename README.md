Cubo CMS
========

## Core package

### Introduction
This module is the actual core for the Cubo CMS and holds several core classes that the framework depends upon.
But even if not using the actual framework, this package can be used to automatically register and load modules (i.e. object classes) into a common namespace.

Note: this package currently only supports ES6

### Install instructions
Add this package as a dependency in your *package.json* and run:
```
npm install
```
The package will automatically register its own core classes.
